# Configuration file for Calamares
#
# This is the top-level configuration file for Calamares.
# It specifies what modules will be used, as well as some
# overall characteristics -- is this a setup program, or
# an installer. More specific configuration is devolved
# to the branding file (for the UI) and the individual
# module configuration files (for functionality).
---
# Modules can be job modules (with different interfaces) and QtWidgets view
# modules. They could all be placed in a number of different paths.
# "modules-search" is a list of strings, each of these can either be a full
# path to a directory or the keyword "local".
#
# "local" means:
#   - modules in $LIBDIR/calamares/modules, with
#   - settings in SHARE/calamares/modules or /etc/calamares/modules.
# In debug-mode (e.g. calamares -d) "local" also adds some paths
# that make sense from inside the build-directory, so that you
# can build-and-run with the latest modules immediately.
#

# A branding component is a directory, either in SHARE/calamares/branding or
# in /etc/calamares/branding (the latter takes precedence). The directory must
# contain a YAML file branding.desc which may reference additional resources
# (such as images) as paths relative to the current directory.
#
branding: cachyos

# If this is set to true, Calamares will show an "Are you sure?" prompt right
# before each execution phase, i.e. at points of no return. If this is set to
# false, no prompt is shown. Default is false, but Calamares will complain if
# this is not explicitly set.
#
prompt-install: true

# If this is set to true, Calamares will execute all target environment
# commands in the current environment, without chroot. This setting should
# only be used when setting up Calamares as a post-install configuration tool,
# as opposed to a full operating system installer.
#
dont-chroot: false

# If this is set to true, Calamares refers to itself as a "setup program"
# rather than an "installer". Defaults to the value of dont-chroot, but
# Calamares will complain if this is not explicitly set.
oem-setup: false

# If this is set to true, the "Cancel" button will be disabled entirely.
# The button is also hidden from view.
#
disable-cancel: false

# If this is set to true, the "Cancel" button will be disabled once
# you start the 'Installation', meaning there won't be a way to cancel
# the Installation until it has finished or installation has failed.
#
disable-cancel-during-exec: false

# If this is set to true, the "Next" and "Back" button will be hidden once
# you start the 'Installation'.
#
hide-back-and-next-during-exec: true

# If this is set to true, then once the end of the sequence has
# been reached, the quit (done) button is clicked automatically
# and Calamares will close.
#
quit-at-end: false
