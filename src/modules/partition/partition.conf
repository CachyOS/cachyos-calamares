# This setting specifies the mount point of the EFI system partition. Some

# etc.) use just /boot.

# Defaults to "/boot/efi", may be empty (but weird effects ensue)

userSwapChoices:
    - none      # Create no swap, use no swap
#    - small     # Up to 4GB
#    - suspend   # At least main memory size
#    - reuse     # Re-use existing swap, but don't create any (unsupported right now)
#    - file      # To swap file instead of partition

# This setting specifies the LUKS generation (i.e LUKS1, LUKS2) used internally by
# cryptsetup when creating an encrypted partition.
#
# This option is set to luks1 by default, as grub doesn't support LUKS2 + Argon2id
# currently. On the other hand grub does support LUKS2 with PBKDF2 and could therefore be
# also set to luks2. Also there are some patches for grub and Argon2.
# See: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grub-improved-luks2-git
#
# Choices: luks1, luks2 (in addition, "luks" means "luks1")
#
# The default is luks1
